This is an example of debugging / adding breakpoints for Jiti launched typescript files
using Visual Studio Code

The launch.json assumes pnpm is being used as the package manager
In order for this to work

  * `JITI_SOURCE_MAPS` should be enabled within launch.json
  * `JITI_CACHE` should be disabled within launch.json
